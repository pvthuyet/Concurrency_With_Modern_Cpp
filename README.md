## II. Memory Model
Before C++11, there was only one contract. The C++ language specification did not include multithreading or atomics. There was no memory model.  
With C++11 everything has changed. C++11 is the first standard aware of multiple threads. The reason for the well-defined behaviour of threads is the C++ memory model that was heavily inspired by the [Java memory model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_memory_model)  
```
enum memory_order{
memory_order_relaxed,
memory_order_consume,
memory_order_acquire,
memory_order_release,
memory_order_acq_rel,
memory_order_seq_cst
}
```
* Read operation: `memory_order_acquire` and `memory_order_consume`
* Write operation: `memory_order_release`
* Read-modify-write operation: `memory_order_acq_rel` and `memory_order_seq_cst`
* Relaxed operation: `memory_order_relaxed`, there are no synchronization or ordering constraints imposed on other reads or writes, only this operation's atomicity is guaranteed.

#### Strong Memory Model (refer to  sequential consistency semantic `memory_order_seq_cst`)
Sequential consistency provides two guarantees:  
* The instructions of a program are executed in source code order.
* There is a global order of all operations on all threads.
  
![1](https://github.com/pvthuyet/Modern-Cplusplus/blob/master/resources/strongmemorymodel.png) 
  
#### Weak Memory Model (refer to relaxed semantic `memory_order_relaxed`)
* The counter-intuitive behaviour is that thread 1 can see the operations of thread 2 in a different orderr, so there is no view of a global clock.  
Fro example, from the perspective of thread 1, it is possible that the operation `res2= x.load()` overtakes `y.store(1)`.
* It is even possible that thread 1 or thread 2 do not perform their operations in the order defined in the source code.  
For example, thread 2 can first execute `res2= x.load()` and then `y.store(1)`.  
This quite very very difficult to understand

## II. Challenges
#### ABA Problem
ABA means you read a value twice and each time it returns the same value A.  
Therefore you conclude that nothing changed in between.  
However, you missed the fact that the value was updated to B somewhere in between.
